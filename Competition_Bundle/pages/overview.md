## Introduction
Understanding pollinator activity is vital for biodiversity research and global food security, yet manual observation from field recordings is slow and impractical at scale. In this project, we use a large set of labeled images extracted from videos of flowers to train a machine-learning model that classifies the type of pollinator in case of a visit. The data might contain images without insects, visual conditions vary strongly across recordings, and the same scene can look very different depending on the camera angle. A key objective is therefore not only accurate classification, but also strong generalization, testing whether a model trained on one viewpoint can successfully recognize pollinators from another. In this project, we focus on the lack of misclassifications. Correctly identifying the pollinator species is important because different insects play different roles in ecosystems. Misclassifying them can lead to incorrect conclusions about species-specific behavior, interactions, and their contribution to pollination.
